## üîÑ Real-time Features

### WebSocket Events
- **project-update**: Project status/details changed
- **application-update**: Application status changed
- **task-update**: Task created/updated/completed
- **comment-added**: New comment posted
- **file-uploaded**: New file attachment

### Room-based Targeting
- **College Rooms**: `projects:{collegeId}`
- **Department Rooms**: `projects:{collegeId}:{department}`
- **Project Rooms**: `project:{projectId}`

### Authentication
WebSocket connections authenticated via JWT tokens with automatic reconnection and exponential backoff.

## üéØ Project Workflow

### Faculty Project Creation
1. Faculty creates project with requirements and deadlines
2. Project enters moderation queue (if required)
3. Admin approves/rejects project
4. Approved projects visible to eligible students

### Student Application Process
1. Student browses project marketplace
2. Submits application with message
3. Faculty reviews applications
4. Application accepted/rejected with notifications
5. Accepted students join project collaboration

### Collaboration Phase
1. Project moves to IN_PROGRESS status
2. Team members access collaboration hub
3. Tasks created and assigned
4. Files shared and discussed
5. Real-time updates via WebSocket

## üîê Security & Authorization

### Role-Based Access
- **Students**: Apply to projects, participate in accepted projects
- **Faculty**: Create projects, manage applications, mentor teams
- **Admins**: Moderate projects, access all college data

### Data Isolation
- College-scoped project visibility
- Department-based filtering options
- Project membership validation for collaboration features

### File Security
- Cloudinary integration for secure file storage
- File type validation and size limits
- Access control based on project membership

## üìà Performance Features

### Caching Strategy
- **Redis Caching**: User identity and profile data
- **Background Refresh**: Automatic cache invalidation
- **Graceful Fallback**: Service continues without cache

### Database Optimization
- **Indexed Queries**: Optimized for common access patterns
- **Pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management

## üß™ Development

### Database Migrations
```bash
# Create migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name

# Deploy migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Reset database (dev only)
npx prisma migrate reset
```

### WebSocket Testing
```bash
# Test WebSocket connection
npm run test:websocket

# Monitor WebSocket events
npm run dev:debug
```

### API Testing
See [POSTMAN_API_TESTING.md](./POSTMAN_API_TESTING.md) for comprehensive API testing scenarios.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Database Connection**: Verify PostgreSQL schema `projectsvc` exists
- **JWT Validation**: Ensure auth service is running and accessible
- **WebSocket Connection**: Check CORS configuration for frontend domain
- **File Upload**: Verify Cloudinary credentials and network access

### Debug Logging
Enable detailed logging with:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development
DEBUG=projects:*
```

Logs include:
- JWT validation steps
- Database query performance
- WebSocket connection events
- File upload progress
- Cross-service API calls
